# AliceInWonderland
Exploring RNNs, GRUs using the Lewis Carroll 'Alice in Wonderland' series

Code is in Python 3.5/Theano 0.8

The training starts out well and flatlines. The regularization I added will keep the weights from blowing up so the gradient must be vanishing.

Need to research this some while I'm working on the reinforcement stuff and come back to it.
